          <h2>Why cycling</h2>
          <h3>Cycling is healthy and cool</h3>
          <p>
            Road cycling is the most widespread form of cycling in which
            cyclists ride on paved roadways. It includes recreational, racing,
            commuting, and utility cycling. As users of the road, road cyclists
            are generally expected to obey the same laws as motorists, however
            there are certain exceptions. While there are many types of bicycles
            that are used on the roads such as BMX, recumbents, racing, touring
            and utility bicycles, dedicated road bicycles have specific
            characteristics that make them ideal for the sport. Road bicycles
            have thinner tires, lighter frames with no suspension, and a set of
            drop handle bars to allow riders to get in a more aerodynamic
            position while cycling at higher speeds.
